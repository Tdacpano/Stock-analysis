# Stock-analysis
Learning VBA through stock data 

Overview of Project
The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).
The purpose of this project was to assist Steve in helping his parents figure out which stocks would be best for them to begin investing their money into. The original goal was to compare the total daily volume of the DQ stock from 2017 & 2018 to other 12 stocks within the data. However, this challenge was to refactor the original code in order to compare the total daily volume to any stock in the stock market, not just the 12 we are limited to. In addition, we wanted to clean the code up and make it more efficient. We are able to test this by using the pop-up messages showing elapsed run time for the refactored code versus the original code.

Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
